  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/json/
    - assets/language/
    - assets/Image_json/image.json
    - assets/lottie/success.json
    - assets/lottie/failed.json
    - assets/images/tukki.png
    # assets:
    #   - assets/images/
    #   - assets/Image_json/

    # - assets/fonts/
    # - assets/language/
    # - family: Gilroy Medium
    #     fonts:
    #       - asset: fonts/Gilroy-Medium.otf

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:

  fonts:
    - family: Gilroy Black
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Gilroy-Black.otf
    - family: Gilroy Light
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Gilroy-Light.otf
    - family: Gilroy Heavy
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Gilroy-Heavy.otf
    - family: Gilroy Medium
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Gilroy-Medium.otf
    - family: Gilroy Bold
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Gilroy-Bold.otf
    - family: Gilroy ExtraBold
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Gilroy-ExtraBold.otf
